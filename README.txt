*To specify key frames: please choose at least 4 key frames
- Drag the slider to a specific frame
- Click "Select Frame" button to select that frame as key frame
- The text box next to the "Select Frame" button displays the number of key frames selected

*To view selected key frames: click on "<" for viewing previous frame or ">" for next frame

*To modify the t value for the Catmull-Rom algorithm: input the t value inside the "t value" text box below the "Interpolate" button
before interpolating.

*To interpolate: click on "Interpolate", after which the character will turn blue, indicating it is demonstrating the 
interpolated frames. The animation will be played in loop.

*To compare between original frames and interpolated frames: click on "Original" toggle button. When ON, it will show the original character
in yellow. When OFF, the character of the interpolated frames is in blue. Their frame numbers are matched, so that you can compare them by
repeatedly toggle between them.

*NOTE:
- Interpolation only works correctly when the frames are selected in order, i.e. forward or backward. It doesn't reorder the frames based
on their frame numbers. For example, if you select frame 2 after selecting frame 1 and frame 3, the result will be incorrect.
- Interpolation only works once after you select all key frames and click on "Interpolate". For another try, please restart this program.
